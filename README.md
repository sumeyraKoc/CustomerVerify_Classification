# CustomerVerify_Classification
The final project of  Elements of Data Science course

In this project, our dataset includes information about reviews and products made to the products of a cosmetic brand. The aim is to correctly guess whether the person commenting on the product is a customer who has actually purchased that product. In order to achieve this goal, we trained and tested two different classification algorithms and compared their performance. All the details of the project are from a single ipnb file (customerVerify.ipynb), but the stages included in our project are generally as follows: (Note:The data types in our data set are: text (containing emotions), numerical, categorical)
